# SageHub Electron+
 ARVR Hackaton Project

Electron+ is  an educational app in the form of a game box  that gives students a better understanding of chemical elements. It Offers new interactive ways to learn about the elements of the periodic table. Each element is represented by a Game Card that can be easily identified by the Vuforia engine which augments the  3D models of each Element's atomic structure. Place the cards side by side to create different chemical results and see the outcome in real-timeâ€¦ Have fun learning.
